# Power-BI-Custom-Themes-and-Version-Control


by visiting the homepage of trader joes we can see what sort of corporate identity they have and which colors they typically use. 

By pasting a screenshot of the page into ms paint we can extract the colors that are a major part of their identity. 

Trader joes uses the following

#C81E24 - Red, their primary color

#2C2C2C - The black seen on their homepage

#FFFFFF - the standard white seen on their homepage and many others

#FAFBF8 - The off white on their homepage

#F1E99C - The yellow of the homepage bell

#093971 - a fun blue they use for their podcast page. 

To these we will add some important other colors such:

#5f5f5f - a Dark gray that will add some weight and utility to our power BI enviroment

#580C13 - a darker red to show value severity. Usually I would use a brighter red but that would be uncomfortable close to their primary brand color

#D5A543 - an yellow that I like for neutral values

#3f9c6d - a green for postive values that feels in line with TJ's Brands use of teriarty colors
