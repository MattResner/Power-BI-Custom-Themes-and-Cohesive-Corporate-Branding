Before -> After Visualization

#### Why should you create a Power BI branding template for your organization?
1. You want your reports to look clean and coherent on an aggregate basis
2. Developer time doesn't need to be spent fiddling with visuals to get them just so
3. Developers don't have completly different levels of polish from report to report
4. Inconcistant brand elements can confuse the data consumer or while consistant brand guidelines can allow for easy recognition and following along

### Integrating Our Trader Joes Style Elements Into our JSON Theme File

### Transforming our Generic Dashboard Automatically with our Theme File


by visiting the homepage of trader joes we can see what sort of corporate identity they have and which colors they typically use. 

By pasting a screenshot of the page into ms paint we can extract the colors that are a major part of their identity. 

Trader joes uses the following

#C81E24 - Red, their primary branding color

#2C2C2C - The black seen on their homepage

#FFFFFF - the standard white seen on their homepage and many others

#FAFBF8 - The off white on their homepage

#F1E99C - The yellow of the homepage bell



#093971 - a fun blue they use for their podcast page. 

To these we will add some important other colors such:

#5f5f5f - a Dark gray that will add some weight and utility to our power BI enviroment

#580C13 - a darker red to show value severity. Usually I would use a brighter red but that would be uncomfortable close to their primary brand color

#D5A543 - an yellow that I like for neutral values

#3f9c6d - a green for postive values that feels in line with TJ's Brands use of teriarty colors
